Union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays.
Given two sorted arrays of size n and m respectively, find their union.


Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
m = 3, arr2 [] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: Distinct elements including 
both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.


class Solution{
    public:
    //arr1,arr2 : the arrays
    // n, m: size of arrays
    //Function to return a list containing the union of the two arrays. 
    vector<int> findUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
    {
        //Your code here
        //return vector with correct order of elements
        set<int>s;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            s.insert(arr1[i]);
        }
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++)
        {
            s.insert(arr2[i]);
        }
        vector<int>v(s.begin(),s.end());
        return v;
    }
};
