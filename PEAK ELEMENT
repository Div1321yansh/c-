An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.
Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. 


Example 1:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Possible Answer: 2
Generated Output: 1
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.
If 2 is returned then the generated output will be 1 else 0.

class Solution
{
    public:
    int peakElement(int arr[], int n)
    {
       // Your code here
       int start=0;
       int end=n-1;
       int mid=start + (end-start)/2;
       while(start<end)
       {
           if(arr[mid]<arr[mid-1])
           {
               end=mid;
           }
           else if(arr[mid]<arr[mid+1])
           {
               start=mid+1;
           }
           else
           {
               return mid;
           }
           mid=start + (end-start)/2;
       }
    }
};
