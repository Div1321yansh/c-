A number N is called a factorial number if it is the factorial of a positive integer. For example, the first few factorial numbers are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,
Given a number N, the task is to return the list/vector of the factorial numbers smaller than or equal to N.

Example 1:

Input: N = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 
1 which is less than equal to N. The second 
number is 2 which is less than equal to N,
but the third factorial number is 6 which 
is greater than N. So we print only 1 and 2
